Sorting algorithms using PHP
============================================================

## Selection sort

Selection sort has an outer loop and an inner loop. The outer loop starts from the first element to the pre-last element of the end, because when it gets to the element right before the last element, the last element should be in its correct position. The inner loop starts from the next of current index of the outer loop to the end of the list. When the inner loop finishes, it will swap the current index of the outer loop with the next maximum value.
